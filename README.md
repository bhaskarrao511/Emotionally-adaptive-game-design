# Emotionally-adaptive-game-design

Abstract. This research paper reviews the latest research in the eld
on emotionally adaptive game design. Adaptive gaming has been around
for some time now, but the emotionally adaptive gaming is a new less
explored area. As quantication and real time capturing of emotions
correctly is still haven't been done successfully.There is much debate
in capturing user's emotions itself. Though there have been attempts
to capture the game player's physiological data using bio-signals like
blood pressure,respiration rate have been done but these approaches are
not perfect. Video games also have multiple elements which they can
change to provide a more immersive experience to the player, and these
change can be based on the player's interaction with the game. This
research paper reviews the various technique, frameworks and arguments
proposed by the researchers in the eld of emotionally adaptive game
design.
